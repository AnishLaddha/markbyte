# About This Blog

Welcome to the blog — a space for sharing ideas, side projects, deep dives into software engineering topics, and the occasional rant about code, design, or developer tools.

The goal here is simple: document what I learn, build things for fun (or necessity), and hopefully help someone else along the way.

## About the Author

I'm a software engineer with a background in computer engineering, passionate about systems, embedded devices, and building full-stack applications. I enjoy breaking things down, learning how stuff works under the hood, and occasionally writing about it.

Expect posts about backend architectures, Linux tools, hardware experiments, and small web tools that solve real problems.

Outside of code, I’m probably reading sci-fi, exploring new coffee spots, or overthinking my dotfiles.
